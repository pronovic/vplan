As of January 2025, I have migrated my home automation infrastructure from
SmartThings to Home Assistant, so I no longer use this software.  It does work,
and is still a decent example of how to accomplish SmartThings automation via
the public API and a personal access token.  However, the repository is
archived and you should consider this code to be unmaintained.
