Remaining work:

- do manual local testing with client and server on Macbook
- test what happens with invalid devices, etc. and figure out how users are supposed to debug it
- adjust build/release process to release wheel and config template to GitHub
- upgrade to Python 3.10 and re-test there
- put back coveralls once project is public
